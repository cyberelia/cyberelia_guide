`/cybr` is the command available to all users and how the player experiences the stroy of cyberelia. 
- For those not registered, it starts them at story_zero where they have to register a name and fight their very first enemy. Upon completion of story_zero, the rest of cyberelia becomes unlocked to them.
- For those already registered, they will run this command to experience the story and unlock other abilities over time to help them progress through the story and grow as a player.
