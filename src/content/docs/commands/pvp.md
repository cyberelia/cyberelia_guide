`/pvp` is a command available to those with the [/user/](/reference/roles/#user) role.

## description

`/fight` engages the user with a one-off encounter with another player. If the battle is won, the user gains xp from the fight; otherwise, the opponent gains xp from the fight. The xp gained from winning a fight is half of the loser's total xp. This may be adjusted in the future, however.
